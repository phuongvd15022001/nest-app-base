# Code Review

**Type:** Workflow

## Trigger

Use when reviewing a backend change set before merge.

## Steps

1. **Understand intent** - Read the requirement, acceptance criteria, API contract, and diff.
2. **Architecture review** - `.claude/agents/backend-reviewer.md` checks module boundaries, provider usage, service responsibilities, and response DTOs.
3. **Security review** - Apply `.claude/skills/backend-security-review/SKILL.md`.
4. **Database review** - Apply `.claude/skills/postgresql/SKILL.md` for Prisma models, migrations, transactions, and queries.

6. **Test review** - Apply `.claude/skills/nestjs-testing/SKILL.md`.
7. **Findings** - Report blocker, should fix, and suggestion items with reason and fix direction.
8. **Re-check** - After changes, re-check every blocker and agreed should-fix item.

## Definition Of Done
